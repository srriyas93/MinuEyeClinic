              <p>
                You may notice "lines" on your face, as early as your 30s and 40s, that result from the expressions you make. These include horizontal lines on your forehead and small, curved lines on your temples, upper cheeks, and around your mouth. Loss of fat below the skin in the cheeks, temples, chin, nose, and eye area may result in loosening skin, sunken eyes, and a "skeletal" appearance.

                The first signs of aging are often wrinkles around your eyes, forehead, cheeks, and lips. Wrinkles are a normal feature of the human face. But many people feel wrinkles make them look tired or older.

                <br><br>
                This is due to the overactivity of muscles which cause deep activity lines on the face mainly around the eyes( crows feet) and forehead.

                “The position of the brow has a major impact on facial expression. An elevated, smooth, youthful looking brow conveys a positive, uplifted state of mind.”
                <br>
                The changes of the forehead and eyebrow area associated with aging include the formation of deep creases across your forehead and between your eyebrows, in association with skin laxity. There is also a gradual descent of your normal brow position that gives your eyebrows a “heavy” look.
                <br><br>
                A brow lift helps to reverse the aging process by tightening a sagging forehead, removing and softening some creases and lifting falling eyebrows.
